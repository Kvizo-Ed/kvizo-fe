### Abstract
Our Turing Capstone project, Kvizo.
This goal of this project was to create a UI/kid friendly application where teachers can create custom multiple choice quizzes and their students can take the quiz. In this app, the teacher can input a question, four multiple choice answers and save this quiz to our Kvizo API. The quizzes are posted to our API when saved and are displayed on the application for the student to find and take the quiz.

### Goals
The goals of this project were to:
- Practice Agile methodology
- Collaborate and work side by side with a Back-End team
- Create an app that is UI friendly to the quiz creators and young quiz takers
- Write modular, reusable code that adheres to SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.
- Make network requests to retrieve and post data from a REST API.

### Challenges
 - Working with Back-End for the first time and figuring out what we needed from eachother
 - Nesting routes so each quiz and question had it's own unique path

### Wins!
 - The design of the website
 - The team coming together and working smoothly with GitHub projectboards and issues
 - Using React Hooks and functional components for state
 - Collaborating with Back-End and being able to learn new technologies with them

### Technologies Used:
- Javascript & React
- HTML, CSS and SASS
- Node.js & NPM
- REST API
- Webpack

### Future Goals
- User can add custom number of answers for multiple choice questions
- Optimize code for faster load times and performance
- Check some elements of accessibility, including testing with a screenreader
- Add login and authentication
- Add new quizzes like Bingo and Jeopardy
